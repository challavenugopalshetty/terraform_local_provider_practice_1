# terraform_local_provider_practice_1

Hello,

I started learning Terraform the IaC(Infrastructure as code) tool. So i created a repo to share and store my knowledge for my reference and also it can help any one.

Always its good to learn a tool by doing smaller projects.

What is Terraform?
- Terraform is Infrastructure provisioning tool that helps in setting up infrastructure on various cloud   platforms and also on on-prem using a human readable configuration files.
- So that we can versionize, reuse and share.
- This configuration files are written in HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language).
- So it is called as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.

How it works?
- Terraform creates and manages the resources on different cloud platforms using API
- Terraform has a terraform provider which connects to any platform via an API
